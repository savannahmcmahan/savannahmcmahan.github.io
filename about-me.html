<p>
My name is Savannah McMahan and I am a sophomore (2021) at Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, DE. At Cab I major in Digital Media with the most experience and interest in photography and graphic design. I currently hold a GPA of 4.8 and am very active around the school surrounding designs, being an officer in Communication Arts Honors Society and being the only Cab student in the Wellness Advisory Council (a program fixated on helping improve school based wellness centers and the mental health of my peers). I am proficient in Adobe Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator (these are the applications I use for graphic design and or photography) and know the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.
<br>
Outside of school I volunteer for Autism Delaware to help raise awareness of Autism Spectrum Disorder and hopefully raise money to help fund upcoming research. I also volunteer at Faithful Friends, an animal shelter, and help take care of the cats until they can find a home.
<br>
On my freetime I enjoy designing as a freelance graphic designer. I have done multiple posters for a Maryland milk company, Dairy Maid Dairy, and have designed their updated logo. I also work for small local business on creating a signature look through logos, posters and small advertisements.
